When developing new educational work programs, teachers need information about professional standards, the labor functions of which correspond to the program being developed (hereinafter referred to as the RAP). Thus, the problem arises of identifying the indices of working disciplines when drawing up their new plan, since it is necessary to go through all the RAP in each educational program of St. Thus, the task and goal of the project is to optimize the work of teachers and improve the quality of education in terms of the correspondence of academic disciplines to professional requirements.

As a result of the work, all the initially set tasks were successfully solved. The team learned to work together, while each team member can work independently and find solutions to the necessary subproblems.
